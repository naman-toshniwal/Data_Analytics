# Data_Analytics
The materials of the Coursera "Google Data Analytics" Course by Google.

This is a basic case study I covered as a part of the Google Data Analytics Course I pursued for the professional certification. 
On studying the various datasets of cyclists in a company with and without membership, I came to certain conclusions for the asks made by the company.

I covered the entire analysis with the help of R programming language and certain points of analysis are attached here along with the project.

The basic conclusions I came to was:

1. I strongly believe that the casual members are mainly composed of tourists and or families who wish to spend their trips and or weekends sightseeing as well as carrying out leisure activities.
2. There’s a strong inclination to believe that annual members are mainly compromised of working adults which use our services as their means of transportation.
3. There’s a possibility that an exploit exists within the single ride pass which would allow irresponsible users to basically own a bike for themselves while only paying a fee for one-time use.


Now, to answer the team’s request, which was: To design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. I would suggest the following:

1. We can clearly see a peak in casual riders on a few occasions: On the weekends as well as in the months of June, July & August. we should prioritize marketing on the said occasions.
2. As a follow up to the previous suggestions, we should advertise promotions on the previous point whereby current casual members would be able to upgrade to annual members at a discount.
3. I would suggest strategically enforcing location-based advertisements (featured on Instagram & Facebook) to target the popular stations among the casual members.


Let's move along, into now recommendations that I would suggest to encourage casual members to upgrade to annual ones.

1. Increase the pricing of single-day & full-day passes. By strategically pricing it higher, it would appeal to upgrade to an annual membership. A great example is described here.
2. Charge/Impose additional fees for non-annual members based on trip duration. A great start would be to impose an additional 10% of your membership fee every 10 minutes after hitting the daily quota.


And, with the help of Tableau, a data visualization tools, I came across certain findings which I'd like to share:
